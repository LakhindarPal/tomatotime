## My process

### Built with

- **HTML5:** Semantic markup for clear document structure and accessibility.
- **CSS3:** Comprehensive styling, including CSS Custom Properties (variables) for dynamic theme and color management, and responsive design techniques.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For timer logic, DOM manipulation, managing user settings via Local Storage, and interactive UI elements.
- **Google Fonts:** Used for providing multiple font style options to the user.

### Continued development

In future iterations, I plan to:

- Implement audible notifications upon timer completion.
- Integrate Web Notification API for desktop alerts when the timer ends.
- Add a feature to track the number of completed Pomodoro sessions.
- Explore more advanced animations for smoother transitions and feedback.
- Consider adding basic task management capabilities.

### Useful resources
